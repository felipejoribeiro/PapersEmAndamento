\section{INTRODUCTION}

PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) is a polymer that has been steadily gaining popularity among the 3D printing community, since it combines the reliability of PLA with the durability of ABS, the two most commonly used materials for FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) \citep{tiposfilamento}. Such fact makes this polymer a good choice when prototyping mechanical parts. PETG may be considered better due to its increased strength, temperature and impact resistance when compared to PLA and ABS.

For all of its advantages, though, when it comes to the finished printed parts, its mechanical properties (as with others materials) present some complications \citep{3Dcomplication}. Since 3D printing is not yet well standardized by the manufacturers, it is impossible to safely predict the final properties of the parts by filament qualities. This problem becomes worse when considering the many parameters that influence the printing part of the process, such as printing temperature, rate, geometry and nozzle width. Another difficulty is that the final FDM part also becomes anisotropic \citep{PETG}, further complicating structural analysis. 

On the present paper, the authors aim to create a database of the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts made with the Prusa i3 MK2S Printer and out of PETG XT filament from 3Dfila. For that, several parameterizations of printing temperature and geometry were used to create testing parts with were subjected to tensile stress until rupture. From those tests the young modulus and Poisson coefficients were measured and used to formulate an statistical theoretical model. It is important to mention that these properties were chosen because they are needed to characterize the material on simulation softwares such as Ansys and Nastran for future structural analysis and material applications.  



\section{METHODOLOGY}





\section{SPECIMENS}

The tensile stress testing parts were designed following the geometry specified in the ASTM D638-02a standard (Type I specimen, with 7mm thickness), Fig.\ref{fig1}.
